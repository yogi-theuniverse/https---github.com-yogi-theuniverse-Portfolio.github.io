							<p>In my stock price prediction project, I embarked on an ambitious endeavor to create a predictive model that could forecast future stock prices with a high degree of accuracy. The project began with the aggregation of a diverse dataset that included historical stock prices, trading volumes, and various macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates and GDP growth rates. Conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, I uncovered significant trends and patterns, such as seasonality and volatility clusters, which informed the subsequent model development. I experimented with several time series forecasting techniques, including ARIMA models for capturing linear dependencies and Prophet models for handling seasonality effects. However, the standout performer was the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which excelled in modeling the complex temporal dependencies inherent in financial data. By leveraging its ability to remember long-term patterns, the LSTM model achieved superior predictive accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods. This project underscored the critical importance of rigorous data preprocessing, model selection, and validation techniques in financial forecasting. It also enhanced my proficiency in handling large datasets, implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, and interpreting model results in the context of market dynamics.</p>
