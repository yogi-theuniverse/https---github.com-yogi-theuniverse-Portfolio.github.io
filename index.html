									<h2>Wine Classification Model</h2>
									<p> In my wine classification project, I developed a robust machine learning model to classify different varieties of wine based on their chemical properties.
										 Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, I employed various data preprocessing techniques, including normalization and feature selection, to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the model. 
										 I experimented with several classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, ultimately optimizing a Random Forest classifier for the best performance.
										  The model achieved a high accuracy rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between wine types. 
										  This project not only enhanced my skills in data manipulation and model tuning but also deepened my understanding of the practical applications of machine learning in the food and beverage industry.</p>

									<h2>Stock Price Prediction</h2>
									<p>In my stock price prediction project, I created a predictive model to forecast future stock prices using historical data.
										 I integrated various data sources to compile a rich dataset, including stock prices, trading volumes, and macroeconomic indicators.
										  Through extensive exploratory data analysis, I identified significant trends and patterns that informed the model development.
										   I implemented time series forecasting techniques, leveraging models such as ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM neural networks. 
										   The LSTM model, in particular, showcased remarkable predictive power, accurately capturing the temporal dependencies of the stock market data.
										    This project provided me with valuable insights into financial data analysis and predictive modeling, underscoring the importance of rigorous data preprocessing and model validation in achieving reliable forecasting results. .</p>
