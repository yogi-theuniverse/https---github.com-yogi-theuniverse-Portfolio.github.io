							<p>In this project, I leveraged a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset to perform an in-depth analysis using Power BI, aimed at providing actionable insights into the pandemic's global and regional impacts. I designed and developed interactive dashboards that allowed for a dynamic exploration of data, featuring heat maps that highlighted areas with the highest infection rates and line graphs that tracked daily new cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time.

                                The analysis included a detailed examination of infection and recovery trends, identifying peak periods of the pandemic and correlating these with government policies and public health interventions. I conducted comparative analyses across different countries and regions to understand variations in impact and response effectiveness. Additionally, predictive models were implemented to forecast future trends in infection rates and healthcare resource needs, which provided valuable insights into potential future scenarios and helped in planning for resource allocation.
                                
                                Throughout the project, I utilized advanced Power BI features such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated fields and measures, as well as Power Query for data transformation and cleaning. This work not only enhanced my technical skills in Power BI but also demonstrated the critical role of data visualization in understanding and addressing complex, real-world challenges.</p>
